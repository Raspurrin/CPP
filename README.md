# CPP

We have to do tons of small exercises to get familiar with C++ including:

|Module| Ex00 | Ex01 | Ex02 | Ex03 | Ex04 | Ex05 | Ex06 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|00| character conversion | class implementation phonebook (adding, searching) | 
|01| Heap allocation | Array allocated on the heap | Reference vs Pointer | Inheritance | File reading/ manipulation | Function pointers instead of if else | Switch instead of if else
|02|
