# CPP

We have to do tons of small exercises to get familiar with C++ including:

|Module| Ex00 | Ex01 | Ex02 | Ex03 | Ex04 | Ex05 | Ex06 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|00| character conversion | class implementation phonebook (adding, searching) | 
|01| Heap allocation | Array allocated on the heap | Reference vs Pointer | Same but in classes | File reading/ manipulation | Function pointers instead of if else | Switch instead of if else
|02| Orthodox Canonical Form | fixed-point number class | operator overloading | trigonometry with fixed class
|03| Inheritance | Inheritance | Inheritance | Inheritance
|04| Polymorphism | cats/dogs?? |Abstract class | Interface
